    assignments:
      - title: Deformable medical image reconstruction using Bayesian deep learning.
        link: ""
        tagline: " We developed end-to-end Bayesian convolutional neural network (CNN's) consisting of downsampling and upsampling convolution layers, pooling layers and
                   batch normalization to register the given pair of images. Lungs CT and cardiac MRI dataset were used in this experiment and got an accuracy of 96% when 
                   compared with its actual ground truth. Tools used are pytorch 1.0, python, sklearn, matplotlib."
        
    
    
      - title: Data augmentation using deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN's).
        link: "https://github.com/vjayd/Face-Generation-using-DCGAN"
        tagline: " 
                  Used deep convolutional GAN’s to augment data. Training was done in min-max way with two CNN networks i.e, generator and discriminator where input 
                  noise vector to generator is taken from gaussian distribution. Dataset used in this experiment is Celeb-A 
                  dataset and tools used are pytorch, spyder and matplotlib."      
        
      - title: Text translation using RNN and attention mechanism.
        link: "https://github.com/vjayd/Text-Translation-using-RNN-and-LSTM-"
        tagline: " Language translation from one language to another using RNN, GRU and autoencoder along with attention Weights.
                   Used teacher forcing as a means to train the network.
                   Dataset used in this experiment is eng-fra translation pair data. Pytorch 1.0, 
                   skimage and matplotlib libraries were used. "


      - title: Image Alignment using Convolutional Autoencoder.
        link: "https://github.com/vjayd/Image-Alignment-using-CNN"
        tagline: "  Given a pair of original image and distored image the task was to align the distorted 
                    image to that of original image. We developed an autoencoder network with spatial transformer module,
                    stochastic gradient descent as optimizer. Used MNIST data set and got accuracy upto 98% between 
                    aligned and original image after transformation. Pytorch 1.0, skimage and matplotlib libraries were used."


      - title: Offline signature verification using Siamese convolutional Network
        link: "https://github.com/vjayd/Signature-verification-using-Siamese-CNN"
        tagline: "  Developed end-to-end siamese CNN which is multi-input CNN architecture containing two identical subnetworks. Our architecture 
                    can take variable size input image with the help of spatial pyramid pooling layer. CEDAR dataset were used for the experiment and observed an accuracy
                    of 78%, Pytorch 1.0, skimage and matplotlib libraries were used."


      - title: Prediction using Random Forest.
        link: "https://github.com/vjayd/Prediction-Model-using-Random-Forest"
        tagline: "  We performed data preprocessing, data wrangling, visualization, exploratory data analysis on the given dataset.
                    we also performed Outlier detection using boxplot,cross validation, feature selection using pearson correlation coefficient,
                    and feature importance.Random forest approach was giving better performance compared to other models with accuracy of 89.90 on test dat
                    Libraries used sklearn, seaborn, numpy, pandas."
